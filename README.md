# Dashboard Reborn✨

A very sexy Flutter template app with great focus on UI, design and animations. Based on [Flutter Dashboard](https://github.com/Ivaskuu/dashboard), [Story App UI](https://github.com/devefy/Flutter-Story-App-UI) and many other open source Flutter projects listed on [Awesome Flutter](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter).

## Building🛠

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website
-   Fork/clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/urmilshroff/dashboard_reborn.git`
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run --release` in the root of the project directory.

**Note:** you can also run it faster in debug mode using 'flutter run', but the animations will be choppy and performance won't be as expected.

Feel free to use this project as a template or starting point in your own Flutter app - it's completely free (as in beer and speech!). However, if you did like this project and found it helpful, kindly fork/star this repo to show your support. It really helps!😁
